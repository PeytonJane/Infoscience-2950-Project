Ideas:
Meet with your group if you are collaborating. Write down at least three ideas
for datasets. Include as much information as possible about the availability of
data.

1) A comparison of different states' economies and purchasing power relative
to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Google, Deloitte, J.P. Morgan have
all published data sets on state, local, and consumer spending throughout
COVID-19 as well as information prior to the pandemic.

2) An analysis of imports and exports from the year 2009 to 2020 in the United
States. These datasets are available on the United Census Bureau. We hope to
research our most common trade partners and the potential impact that different
presidencies had on trade.

3) E-commerce versus brick and mortar purchases in 2010 to 2020. These datasets
are available on the United States Census Bureau. This idea would allow us to
delve into the rise of e-commerce and establish the effects of its success.


Questions for reviewers :
1) In the case of doing a project based on Covid-19, is a year of a half of data
acceptable?
2) Is it too soon to analyze meaningful impacts from the pandemic?
3) Are our ideas too broad? Have we established a small enough frame of reference?
